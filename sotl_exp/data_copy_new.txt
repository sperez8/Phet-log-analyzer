A pilot course was designed and delivered in 2014S, then evaluated in two phases in 2014W. Evaluation findings informed the development of course resources and tools which were implemented in the course in 2015.

The UBC Integrated Ethics Curriculum (iEthics) brings together educators, learners, and patients/clients to develop a prototype of an integrated curriculum focusing on three pillars of learning: uni-professional, multi-professional, and inter-professional. This curriculum will strengthen learning that is unique to a profession and create opportunities for inter-professional learning that requires skilled collaboration among health care providers, patients/clients, and families. The interdisciplinary project team has developed a curricular model, exit competencies, milestones, and foundational learning activities. These learning activities have been piloted with current health and human services students and faculty and refined based on their feedback. Subsequent phases of the project will see the development of the remaining activities in the curriculum.

To our knowledge, there is no precedent for such a comprehensive and broad integrated curriculum. The topic chosen for the exemplar of an integrated curriculum is ethic as it is common across professions, resonates across all areas of practice, and is critical in today’s world of complex, often technology-enhanced healthcare. The UBC Integrated Ethics Curriculum (iEthics) brings together educators, learners, and patients/clients to develop a prototype of an integrated curriculum focusing on three pillars of learning: uni-professional, multi-professional, and inter-professional. This curriculum will strengthen learning that is unique to a profession and create opportunities for inter-professional learning that requires skilled collaboration among health care providers, patients/clients, and families. The interdisciplinary project team has developed a curricular model, exit competencies, milestones, and foundational learning activities. These learning activities have been piloted with current health and human services students and faculty and refined based on their feedback. Subsequent phases of the project will see the development of the remaining activities in the curriculum.

To our knowledge, there is no precedent for such a comprehensive and broad integrated curriculum. The topic chosen for the exemplar of an integrated curriculum is ethic as it is common across professions, resonates across all areas of practice, and is critical in today’s world of complex, often technology-enhanced healthcare. The UBC Integrated Ethics Curriculum (iEthics) brings together educators, learners, and patients/clients to develop a prototype of an integrated curriculum focusing on three pillars of learning: uni-professional, multi-professional, and inter-professional. This curriculum will strengthen learning that is unique to a profession and create opportunities for inter-professional learning that requires skilled collaboration among health care providers, patients/clients, and families. The interdisciplinary project team has developed a curricular model, exit competencies, milestones, and foundational learning activities. These learning activities have been piloted with current health and human services students and faculty and refined based on their feedback.

By placing the lecture and the resources online, students will be able to explore the Inquiry materials at length and at their own pace. Online materials include original speeches, newspaper clippings, documentary files, and interviews with individuals from the UBC and legal communities who participated in the inquiry.

Allard School of	Law	A number of UBC Faculties offer courses dealing with environmental issues, Aboriginal rights and northern development. The Berger Inquiry is an important case study that allows us to understand how these issues interconnect. This project aimed at creating a unique 5-part overview lecture series, as well as an integrated “kit” of interactive media that can be used online by students and instructors of different Faculties across the university. Currently, many courses are imparted in lecture formats with slides. This does not allow students to explore the original speeches or the newspaper clippings or the documentary files from the Berger inquiry, which give historical context to the lecture. By placing the lecture and the resources online, students will be able to explore the Inquiry materials at length and at their own pace.

In addition to developing a flipped and blended pedagogy and associated resources for BIOL 112 and BIOL 121, the project will also identify high priority modular content for vertical integration in the Biology curriculum and prepare artefacts for the stand-alone resource bank for biology. Pilots will be offered in September 2013 and January 2014, and delivery of the fully transformed courses will take place in September 2014.
