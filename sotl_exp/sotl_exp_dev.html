In addition to developing a flipped and blended pedagogy and associated resources for BIOL 112 and BIOL 121, the project will also identify high priority modular content for vertical integration in the Biology curriculum and prepare artefacts for the stand-alone resource bank for biology. Pilots will be offered in September 2013 and January 2014, and delivery of the fully transformed courses will take place in September 2014."
