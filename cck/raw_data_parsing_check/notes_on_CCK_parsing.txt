TODO
--------
add "voltmeter attached to working circuit" column
add "contact ammeter attached to working circuit" column
add "series ammeter attached to working circuit" column


reset all: currently all removal actions are considered user actions but are ignored.
parse short pauses - can be done in Jupyter
sometimes remove component is an Organize action... WTF
there are 2 wires that are removed but never added... see below for details (in activity 2, there are a dozen in activity 1)

take a closer look at ignored lines

only paper clip and penny conduct and their resistance is zero or very low because fire starts
dog, hand, pencil, eraser, and dollar bill don't
need to track this?

thoughts on logging different kinds of tests:

#what to do with circuit switch?
#check loop counter
#do we care if series ammeter is in current circuit or not?

for now, keeping only "deliberate _measure" - ignores some "endMeasure", and all startmeasures with no actual outcomes
note that currently "PlayPause" is a kind of test
NEED TO FIX DATA GIVEN THAT SOME STUDENTS HAVE DIFFERENT IDS IN BOTH DATAFRAMES. see load_data.ipynb
somehow lost pauses
keep track of exceptions. ex: Test+other can be a lot of things

Notes on generate_cck_csV_REWRITTEN.py

The ignored lines are often model events such as battery current change. But sometimes they are also when connections are formed by testing tools. Maybe ignored because time between actions was really low?
Simply looking at "grabresistor, addedcomponent" actions that were ignored, seems like the magic time elapsed threshold is 0.016 seconds...

Actions that I think should not be ignored (SEE BELOW for all ignored actions):
Any component:
	currentChanged
	endDrag
	startDrag
	removedComponent
	AddComponent

Ignore_flag =1 when:
feedback		current change on battery, ammeters
feedback		fire is start or ended in different places
ignore		dialog boxes are opened/closed
building		start and ned drag on battery resistance, resistivity
ignore		if last drag value is really small
ignore		movedComponent if immediately followed by junction formed
building		adding grabbag resistor



WHat has been done

	script can draw graphs

	I renamed variables which seemed o have several names and were beind called without declaration...

	I made it such that circuit info is always print. WARNING: Graph was updated after writing but is no longer.

	Added a "count" of the number of circuits with at least 1 battery.

	Sometimes, junctions are splits or items are removed from graph which arent there. These are either bugs due to adding grabresistor using a different action then other items or bugs in raw code.

	#loops always gives the number of loops of the circuit (with battery or not) where the component of that action is. No longer. Now both are outputed: all circuit currently built, and currently worked on.	

	Grabbagresistors now added to circuit properly so there is no error when they are removed.

WATCHING the THU AM video, Here is what actions I wouldlike to capture
Adding components
Building
created 1 connected circuit
testing ammeter
testing voltmeter
removed element, implicit feedback from voltmeter
created 1 connected circuit, implicit feedback from voltmeter (since it's connected)
testing voltmeter
pause
removed component
created 1 connected circuit, implicit feedback 
testing ammeter
changing component - implicit feedback (fire) and from voltemeter and ammeter
testing ammeter
changing component - implicit feedback (fire) and from voltemeter and ammeter
testing voltmeter
changing component - implicit feedback (fire) and from voltemeter and ammeter
pause
build
complete 2 ciruits
complete 1 circuit
testing voltemter
remove component
testing voltmeter on 2 circuits

build crcuit 1
build circuit 2
