TODO
--------
Need to change how grab-bag resistor is logged. it's only added to cricuit once connected. ALso need to take note if current flows through it or not.

Notes on generate_cck_csV_REWRITTEN.py

The ignored lines are often model events such as battery current change. But sometimes they are also when connections are formed by testing tools. Maybe ignored because time between actions was really low?
Simply looking at "grabresistor, addedcomponent" actions that were ignored, seems like the magic time elapsed threshold is 0.016 seconds...

Actions that I think should not be ignored (SEE BELOW:
Any component:
	currentChanged
	endDrag
	startDrag
	removedComponent
	AddComponent

Ignore_flag =1 when
	current change on battery, ammeters
	fire is start or ended in different places
	dialog boxes are opened/closed
	start and ned drag on battery resistance, resistivity
	if last drag value is really small
	movedComponent if immediately followed by junction formed
	adding grabbag resistor





script can draw graphs

I renamed variables which seemed o have several names and were beind called without declaration...

I made it such that circuit info is always print. WARNING: Graph was updated after writing but is no longer.

To "count" the number of circuits now, before it simply check for closed loops in the subgraph. Now it checks for closed loops and at least 1 battery.

Sometimes, junctions are splits or items are removedfrom graph which arent there. These are either bugs due to adding grabresistor using a different action then other items or bugs in raw code.

#loops always gives the number of loops of the circuit (with battery or not) where the component of that action is.


WATCHING the THU AM video, Here is what actions I wouldlike to capture
Adding components
Building
created 1 connected circuit
testing ammeter
testing voltmeter
removed element, implicit feedback from voltmeter
created 1 connected circuit, implicit feedback from voltmeter (since it's connected)
testing voltmeter
pause
removed component
created 1 connected circuit, implicit feedback 
testing ammeter
changing component - implicit feedback (fire) and from voltemeter and ammeter
testing ammeter
changing component - implicit feedback (fire) and from voltemeter and ammeter
testing voltmeter
changing component - implicit feedback (fire) and from voltemeter and ammeter
pause
build
complete 2 ciruits
complete 1 circuit
testing voltemter
remove component
testing voltmeter on 2 circuits

build crcuit 1
build circuit 2
