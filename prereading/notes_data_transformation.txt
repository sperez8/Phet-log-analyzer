DATA TRANSFORMATION FROM .XLSX
---------------------------------------
removed first two rows and empty columns
change all commas to ;
convert to csv
removed weird space replace by '?' using Sublime text
Clickerscore.Blackbody -> ClickerScore.Blackbody



NOTES ON SURVEY DATA 
---------------------------------------
removed first two rows and empty columns
change all commas to ;
convert to csv
N\A, #NA and <Unanswered> converted to NA
since we have missing data for the blackbody topic, added two question columns for time on text and time on phet for Blackbody (data all NA), and a column for "encountered before" question
removed some data points: someone spent 41200 minutes on phet...
cleaned time : siwtched ranges to numbers (25-30 to 30) and removed "min","minutes"
