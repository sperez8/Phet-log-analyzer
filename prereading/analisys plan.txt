------------------------------------------------------------
TODO!!! in order
----------------

add encountered column
remove "for topic"
add clicker score

redo engagement boxplots with tertial engagement

perform all 8 t-tests

build model for clickerscore

compare clickerscore to postscore.



calculate overall attitude about phet
make PCA of attitude, knowledge of phet and pre-knowledge

MEETING NOTES

tertile engagement?

QUESTIONS (t-tests to do )
	-if they already encountered the topic were they more likely to be engaged?
	-if they already encountered the topic were they more likely to have a high prescore?
	-if they enjoyed the activity, were they more likely to be engaged?
	-if they benefitted from the activity, were they more likely to be engaged?

	-> redo per condition


How is engagement*condition related to the outcome?
-building model for postscore
-building model for Clickscore


Hypothesis: the reading assgignment aided certain students:
	-by attitude (high versus low)
	-by pre-knowledge
	-by engagement
-> look into the potential of an equalizing force


did the assignment prepare them for class? ie. what is the difference between clickerscore and postscore?
